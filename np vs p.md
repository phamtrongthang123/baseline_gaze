The slides has NP definition and a lot of precious details on proving np complete. Some other notes:
- The complexity of decision is <= the optimization version of a problem 
- X <=_p Y is polynomial-time reducibility, the meaning is the the complexity X < Y, but not means O(n^?) < O(n^??), but only mean that if Y can be solve polynomial time, then X is also, and conversely, if x in intractible, then y is also. 
- cook's theorem: SAT is NP complete, if X in NP, then X <=_p SAT; and if SAT <=_p X, then X is NP complete. 
- Assisgments will ask proving reducibility yourself, thankfully the slides has some examples.
